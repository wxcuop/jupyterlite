Only the Python standard library is available after importing Pyodide. To use other packages, youâ€™ll need to load them using either:

micropip.install() (Python) for pure Python packages with wheels as well as Pyodide packages (including Emscripten/wasm32 binary wheels). 

It can install packages from PyPI, the JsDelivr CDN or from other URLs.

pyodide.loadPackage() (Javascript) for packages built with Pyodide. 

This is a function with less overhead but also more limited functionality. 

micropip uses this function to load Pyodide packages. 

In most cases you should be using micropip.

In some cases, and in particular in the REPL, packages are installed implicitly from imports. 

The Pyodide REPL uses pyodide.loadPackagesFromImports() to automatically download all packages that the code snippet imports. 

This is useful since users might import unexpected packages in REPL.

At present, loadPackagesFromImports() will not download packages from PyPI, it will only download packages included in the Pyodide distribution.
