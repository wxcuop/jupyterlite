- please note that the browser’s local storage has a limited capacity, and you might not be able to upload large files. But smaller files up to ~50MB should be fine.

## DuckDB limitations
- https://duckdb.org/2024/10/02/pyodide.html
- https://github.com/iqmo-org/magic_duckdb

Running in the browser is a more restrictive environment (for security purposes), so there are some limitations when using DuckDB in Pyodide. There is no free lunch!

Single-threaded
Pyodide currently limits execution to a single thread

### A few extra steps to query remote files
Remote files can't be accessed by DuckDB directly

Instead, pull the files locally with Pyodide first

DuckDB-Wasm has custom enhancements to make this possible, but these are not present in DuckDB's Python client


## DuckDB limitations
No runtime-loaded extensions

Several extensions are automatically included: parquet, json, icu, tpcds, and tpch.

Release cadence aligned with Pyodide

At the time of writing, duckdb-pyodide is at 1.1.2
